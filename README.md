# OA-S-Hackpad
My hackpad! It has 9 keys and an OLED screen, I plan to use the extra keys as binds for playing games, and I might just have a cool image on the screen.

The overall hackpad with the PCB, in an assembly file:

The individual pieces of the case:

Bill of Materials:
9x Cherry MX Switches
1x 0.91 inch OLED display
1x XIAO RP2040
9x Blank DSA Keycaps
4x M3x16 Bolt
4x M3 Heatset

The project definitely took a while to learn and make, since it was my first ever PCB. I had some help with autocad inventor since my brother already uses it and helped me make the case, but overall this
project was 99% my own effort! I hope the hackpad comes out well and I can maybe have some less difficulty assembling it!
